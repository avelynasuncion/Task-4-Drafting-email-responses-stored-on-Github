Dear Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out to us. We understand your desire to continue with the TIP101 course, and we appreciate your willingness to take responsibility for the missed coursework.

As you know, our course policies are in place to ensure that all students are able to fully engage with the material and meet the necessary requirements. Unfortunately, due to non-compliance with our coursework submission deadlines, you were withdrawn from the class. Typically, before withdrawing students, we reach out via email or slack to ask for reason why the coursework was not submitted, but we did not receive any response from you, which is why we proceeded with the withdrawal.

While we are unable to reinstate students into the current course once they have been withdrawn, we want to emphasize that you still have lifetime access to the course materials through the GitHub account you used to sign up. This will allow you to continue learning and working through the material at your own pace. We encourage you to take full advantage of this access and continue your preparation for technical interviews.

If you’re still interested in completing the coursework, we recommend that you review the missed assignments and work through them independently using the course resources provided. We’re here to support you along the way, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need additional guidance as you work through the material.

We appreciate your commitment to improving your skills, and we are confident that with continued effort, you’ll be able to catch up. If there's anything else we can do to help, don’t hesitate to let us know.

Thank you for your understanding, and we wish you all the best as you continue your learning journey.

Best regards,

CodePath Support
