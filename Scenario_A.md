Dear John,

Thank you for your response and for sharing more about your background. We truly appreciate your interest and the strong academic achievements you've made as a straight-A sophomore from MIT. It's clear you have a strong foundation in your studies, and we commend your drive to further develop your skills.

We understand your desire to be placed in the Advanced track for the Technical Interview Prep program. However, as part of our admissions process, we base primarily on the results of the pre-work and technical interview assessment. This helps us ensure that each student is placed in the track that best matches their current abilities, allowing them to receive the most appropriate level of instruction and maximize their learning experience.

While your academic record is impressive, the Intermediate track will better align with the current skill level shown in your pre-work. We believe this will allow you to strengthen the foundational concepts and pace necessary for success. The Advanced track is designed for students with a higher level of preparation in these areas, and we want to ensure that all participants are in a class where they can fully engage and thrive.

We genuinely want you to have the best possible experience and believe that starting in the Intermediate track will set you up for success. Should you feel ready for more advanced content after completing this track, you will have the opportunity to pursue further learning in advanced areas.

Thank you again for your understanding and look forward to having you in the Intermediate track. Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.


Best regards,

CodePath Support
