Dear Jane,

Thank you for your message and for sharing your thoughts with us. First and foremost, we truly appreciate the time and effort you put into building the Flix app. We understand how much dedication it took to complete the application process, and we recognize the frustration you must feel in light of the eligibility requirements.

We sincerely apologize if the eligibility requirements werenâ€™t as clear as they should have been. We make every effort to outline them, but we understand how easy it is to overlook them in the application process. We appreciate your feedback, as it helps us improve the clarity of our communications for future applicants.

As a non-profit organization, our current sponsorships and partnerships limit us to offering our courses to students enrolled at universities within the United States. While we are expanding to new locations and have previously operated in places like Taiwan and Haiti, we do not yet have the capacity to extend our program internationally beyond our U.S.-based partner universities.

We deeply understand your desire to continue learning, and we sincerely wish we could make an exception in your case. However, due to the constraints of our current program structure, we are unable to offer enrollment outside of the U.S. at this time.

Please know that we value your enthusiasm and commitment to learning, and we will keep your information on file. As we continue to expand, we hope to be able to offer more opportunities in the future to international students. In the meantime, we encourage you to explore other learning platforms that may better align with your current location and goals.

Thank you again for your understanding, and we truly appreciate your interest in CodePath. If you have any further questions and clarification or would like to stay updated on future opportunities, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

CodePath Support
