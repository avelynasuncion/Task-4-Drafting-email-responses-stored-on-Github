Dear Anne,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation with us. We deeply understand how important the Summer Interview Prep course to you, especially given your upcoming graduation and the challenges you've faced with your internship applications. We can only imagine how frustrating it must be to have worked so hard and to put so much time and effort and still be facing setbacks, and we truly sympathize with your circumstances.

Unfortunately, the Summer Interview Prep course is currently full, and with a long waitlist in place, we are unable to offer you a spot this year. We wish we could accommodate everyone who applies, especially someone as dedicated as you, but as much as we'd love to help, our course capacity is limited. Typically, we encourage applicants in your situation to reapply next year. However, I completely understand that, with graduation approaching, you’ll no longer be eligible to participate again next time. This situation certainly breaks our hearts.

While we can't offer you a spot in this year's course, we still want to support you as much as we can during your job search. I’d like to share our high-level software interview guide, which includes valuable tips and strategies that might help you continue preparing for interviews. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our Resources Page, which offers a wealth of information that can aid you in your preparation. We also invite you to sign up for our mailing list, where we share updates on future courses, virtual events, and other opportunities that may be relevant to you.

Please know that we believe in your potential and understand how challenging this process can be. We’re rooting for your success, and we hope the resources we’ve shared help you on your path. If you have any other questions or need further support, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here for you.

Wishing you all the best as you continue your job search,

CodePath Support
